# 并查集

并查集是一种多子集的数据结构，每个子集元素都是不相交的，也可以叫“不交集”。

举个例子，如下的数据结构就是一个并查集:

	[ a, b, f, k ]
	[ e ]
	[ g, d, c ]
	[ i, j ]

这些集合是不相交的，因为每个集合没有相同的元素。

并查集支持3个基本操作:

1. **Find(A)**: 找出元素A是哪个子集，比如`find(d)` 返回子集 `[ g, d, c ]` 对应的根节点索引.

2. **Union(A, B)**: 合并A、B2个子集. 比如, `union(d, j)` 合并 `[ g, d, c ]` 和 `[ i, j ]` 变成一个更大的子集 `[ g, d, c, i, j ]`.

3. **AddSet(A)**: 添加一个只包含 **A**的子集. 比如, `addSet(h)` 就会添加一个新子集 `[ h ]`.

The most common application of this data structure is keeping track of the connected components of an undirected [graph](../Graph/). It is also used for implementing an efficient version of Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

## Implementation

并查集有几种不同的实现方式，这里我们采用一种简单有效的实现方式：加权quick-union算法

```swift
public struct UnionFind<T: Hashable> {
  private var index = [T: Int]()
  private var parent = [Int]()
  private var size = [Int]()
}
```

这种数据实现方式非常像‘森’，而其中每一个子集就是‘树’。

按照这种方式，每个子集的代表就是子集树的根节点，我们使用一个 `parent` 数组，其中每个数表示该元素对应的父节点的索引。

比如:  `parent` 数组是这样的,

	parent [ 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 6, 6, 6 ]
	     i   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

那么子集的树形结构就是这样的:

	      1              6
	    /   \           / \
	  0       2        7   8
	 / \     /
	3   5   4

我们给每个子集一个唯一的标记，那就是这个树的根节点，在上图中，1就是第一个树的标记，6是第二颗树的标记。

所以在这个例子中，我们有2个子集1和6；而 **Find** 函数返回就是子集的标记，而不是子集的内容。

在`parent[]` 数组中，子集的根节点指向的父节点就是自己. 比如 `parent[1] = 1`  `parent[6] = 6`. 

## Add set

并查集的3个基础操作之一，添加一个新子集

```swift
public mutating func addSetWith(_ element: T) {
  index[element] = parent.count  // 1
  parent.append(parent.count)    // 2
  size.append(1)                 // 3
}
```

当你添加一个新元素的时候，其实是添加一个只包含该元素的子集。

1. 保存新元素的索引在 `index` 字典中，这样可以保证后续查找速度。

2.   `parent` 添加该元素的索引，该子集只有当前一个元素，所以 `parent[i]` 就是当前元素索引。

3. `size[i]` is the count of nodes in the tree whose root is at index `i`. For the new set this is 1 because it only contains the one element. We'll be using the `size` array in the Union operation.

## Find

Often we want to determine whether we already have a set that contains a given element. That's what the **Find** operation does. In our `UnionFind` data structure it is called `setOf()`:

```swift
public mutating func setOf(_ element: T) -> Int? {
  if let indexOfElement = index[element] {
    return setByIndex(indexOfElement)
  } else {
    return nil
  }
}
```

This looks up the element's index in the `index` dictionary and then uses a helper method to find the set that this element belongs to:

```swift
private mutating func setByIndex(_ index: Int) -> Int {
  if parent[index] == index {  // 1
    return index
  } else {
    parent[index] = setByIndex(parent[index])  // 2
    return parent[index]       // 3
  }
}
```

Because we're dealing with a tree structure, this is a recursive method.

Recall that each set is represented by a tree and that the index of the root node serves as the number that identifies the set. We're going to find the root node of the tree that the element we're searching for belongs to, and return its index.

1. First, we check if the given index represents a root node (i.e. a node whose `parent` points back to the node itself). If so, we're done.

2. Otherwise we recursively call this method on the parent of the current node. And then we do a **very important thing**: we overwrite the parent of the current node with the index of root node, in effect reconnecting the node directly to the root of the tree. The next time we call this method, it will execute faster because the path to the root of the tree is now much shorter. Without that optimization, this method's complexity is **O(n)** but now in combination with the size optimization (covered in the Union section) it is almost **O(1)**.

3. We return the index of the root node as the result.

Here's illustration of what I mean. Let's say the tree looks like this:

![BeforeFind](Images/BeforeFind.png)

We call `setOf(4)`. To find the root node we have to first go to node `2` and then to node `7`. (The indices of the elements are marked in red.)

During the call to `setOf(4)`, the tree is reorganized to look like this:

![AfterFind](Images/AfterFind.png)

Now if we need to call `setOf(4)` again, we no longer have to go through node `2` to get to the root. So as you use the Union-Find data structure, it optimizes itself. Pretty cool!

There is also a helper method to check that two elements are in the same set:

```swift
public mutating func inSameSet(_ firstElement: T, and secondElement: T) -> Bool {
  if let firstSet = setOf(firstElement), let secondSet = setOf(secondElement) {
    return firstSet == secondSet
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

Since this calls `setOf()` it also optimizes the tree.

## Union (Weighted)

The final operation is **Union**, which combines two sets into one larger set.

```swift
    public mutating func unionSetsContaining(_ firstElement: T, and secondElement: T) {
        if let firstSet = setOf(firstElement), let secondSet = setOf(secondElement) { // 1
            if firstSet != secondSet {                // 2
                if size[firstSet] < size[secondSet] { // 3
                    parent[firstSet] = secondSet      // 4
                    size[secondSet] += size[firstSet] // 5
                } else {
                    parent[secondSet] = firstSet
                    size[firstSet] += size[secondSet]
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

Here is how it works:

1. We find the sets that each element belongs to. Remember that this gives us two integers: the indices of the root nodes in the `parent` array.

2. Check that the sets are not equal because if they are it makes no sense to union them.

3. This is where the size optimization comes in (Weighting). We want to keep the trees as shallow as possible so we always attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. To determine which is the smaller tree we compare trees by their sizes.

4. Here we attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree.

5. Update the size of larger tree because it just had a bunch of nodes added to it.

An illustration may help to better understand this. Let's say we have these two sets, each with its own tree:

![BeforeUnion](Images/BeforeUnion.png)

Now we call `unionSetsContaining(4, and: 3)`. The smaller tree is attached to the larger one:

![AfterUnion](Images/AfterUnion.png)

Note that, because we call `setOf()` at the start of the method, the larger tree was also optimized in the process -- node `3` now hangs directly off the root.

Union with optimizations also takes almost **O(1)** time.

## Path Compression
```swift
private mutating func setByIndex(_ index: Int) -> Int {
    if index != parent[index] {
        // Updating parent index while looking up the index of parent.
        parent[index] = setByIndex(parent[index])
    }
    return parent[index]
}
```
Path Compression helps keep trees very flat, thus find operation could take __ALMOST__ in __O(1)__
